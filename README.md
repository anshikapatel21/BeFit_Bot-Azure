# BeFit_Bot-Azure
This repository contains source code of a Bot named as BeFit_Bot created through Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services during Future Ready Talent Virtual Internship Program.

I have created a chatbot named as BeFit.It is a user friendly knowledge based bot. 
It provides information about the exercises or yoga, also which one to perform for different body parts. I have connected the chatbot with telegram where a user can access the information about different exercises and about the best websites to visit for more information about that particular exercise. 

I have used Azure Bot Service, QnA maker and Azure Cognitive services as primary azure technologies in this project.
